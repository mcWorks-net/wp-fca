                <h2>Program Rationale</h2>
                <p>
                  FCA’s mission is “to facilitate holistic and caring Christian
                  education that develops learners in godly character and
                  academic ability, while creating positive social impact and
                  being a fun, meaningful place to work.” In keeping with this
                  mission, FCA proposes to launch its High School Academic
                  Scholarship program, aside from its Student Sponsorship
                  Program.
                </p>
                <p>
                  FCA desires to increase the academic caliber of its students.
                  Launching an academic scholarship program which would attract
                  the best, brightest, most deserving students would enhance and
                  encourage the existing student population, which will always
                  consist of a maximum of 30% sponsored children from
                  marginalized communities.
