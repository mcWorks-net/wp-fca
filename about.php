                <h2>The Founders</h2>
                <p>
                  Jeffrey Pessina was born in Illinois, USA, and is one of ten
                  children. At the age of twenty, after a long period of drug
                  addiction and alcohol abuse, God changed His life. Five weeks
                  after his decision to become a Christ-follower, he left for
                  the Philippines to serve as a missionary. He met his wife,
                  Rowena Pessina, in 1983. They married in 1986 and have four
                  grown children. In 1987 they incorporated the Philippine
                  Frontline Ministries, Inc (PFM), an evangelistic team ministry
                  that was then fully mobile, and traveled throughout the nation
                  sharing the good news of Christ Jesus. In 2000, PFM moved to
                  establish a mission center in San Pablo City, Laguna and
                  branched out into other initiatives. Frontline now oversees a
                  growing multi-site church (Frontline Worship Center), a
                  program to protect and develop abandoned and abused children
                  (Face the Children), a Christian school (Frontline Christian
                  Academy, Inc.), and is involved in compassionate ministries to
                  change the lives of the marginalized poor through social
                  enterprise businesses and livelihood programs.

                <h2>The History of FCA</h2>
                <p>
                  Frontline Christian Academy, Inc. (FCA) began initially as a
                  home school for the staff children of the Philippine Frontline
                  Ministries, Inc., (PFM) (www.thefrontline.asia). Later PFM
                  decided to pursue solutions for abandoned and abused street
                  children, and established a child care initiative named Face
                  the Children (FTC) (www.facethechildren.org). In line with
                  this initiative, the strategic scope of FCA was expanded to
                  meet the educational needs of the children being cared for
                  under the FTC program.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  What had started in 2003 with 17 students in a doublewide
                  air-conditioned trailer, located in a small compound in Brgy.
                  San Francisco, San Pablo City, quickly expanded. In 2007, FCA
                  was moved to a more suitable, larger venue, in the same
                  barangay. FCA was officially incorporated as a non-stock,
                  non-profit educational institution in July 2009, and obtained
                  the necessary permits from the Department of Education in
                  2011. FCA refers to 2009 as its official “first year.”
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  FCA moved to its permanent location in Baloc Rd., Brgy. San
                  Ignacio, in year 2020.

                    <p>
                      The most important commandment of the Scriptures is “You
                      shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with
                      all your soul, and with all your mind,” and “‘You shall
                      love your neighbor as yourself. We genuinely love and care
                      for each other, our students, and their families, our
                      donors, partners, and all stakeholders… and desire for
                      them to walk in the fullness of the promise of abundant
                      life. This desire drives us to pursue exceptional customer
                      service and high client satisfaction. We also genuinely
                      love and care for our employees, and aim to be a fun and
                      meaningful place to work, and to provide a conducive
