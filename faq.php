                    is Social Emotional Learning (in partnership with a US Youth
                    Leadership organization: “Growing Leaders”), mentoring, and
                    leadership development. We believe this is something that
                    our young people need, especially in such challenging and
                    unprecedented global times. We also prioritize the holistic
                    development and wellbeing of our students, their families,
                    and our staff and faculty, providing periodic group
                    counseling sessions for parents and students with a
                    PRC-registered Guidance Counselor. We provide genuinely
                    caring support for families, and host monthly Parenting Peer
                    Groups (PPGs), which are gatherings (online/virtual if
                    in-person is not possible) of small groups of parents to
                    provide moral support and academic support to one another.
                    FCA accepts students from diverse backgrounds, religions,
                    and walks of life. Our primary language used for teaching
                    and communication is the English language, except for the
                    subjects of Filipino, Araling Panlipunan, and certain topics
                    under Home Economics and Livelihood Education/Technology and
                    Livelihood Education. We also put a high value on real-life
                    skills, working hard to prepare students for life after and
                    outside school.

                    best to not overload its students; the amount of work
                    assigned is very doable, as long as the student can focus
                    during class times and is given support by his/her family.
                    For assigning online tasks, FCA uses Google Classroom, and
